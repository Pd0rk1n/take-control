Who this post is for

Someone who wants to see what other pacman users regularly use
What this post isn't
Principle of pacman design
Detail explanation of the commands
Replacement of the documentation (duh!)
Everything in this post can of course be found easily using pacman --help. But that's a documentation. It has a lot more than you'd ever need. This post will help you filter out the few good stuff (read: regularly used) from the vast documentation.

Here's a list of commands I personally use. I never had the need to use anything more than what's listed here.

The Basics
Upgrade local packages
sudo pacman -Syu
This command is probably the most used pacman command by quite some distance. It does 2 things

downloads a fresh package list.
upgrades all the installed pacakges that are out of date.
Pacman keeps a local copy of the package list in the system, so it doesn't have to download the list every time you run a command. The -y flag forces pacman to download a fresh copy of the package list from the repositories.

Install packages
sudo pacman -S <package-name>
Search for packages
sudo pacman -Ss <package-name>
Remove packages
sudo pacman -Rns <package-name>
Clean cache
sudo pacman -Sc

Still basics but rarely used
These are a list of commands that you probably wouldn't use on a daily basis.

List all packages that are no longer required
pacman -Qdt
Remove all packages that are no longer required
sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qdtq)
Info of a package
pacman -Qi <package-name>
